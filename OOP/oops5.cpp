/*
Pillars of OOPS:  main pillar={Abstraction}, {Loose coupling};

1.Abstraction:Implementation details are hide is called abstraction.
->Ex:We dont care the implementation of ATM,like HOW ?, what ?,   why?.
->part of abstraction is called loose coupling:


2.Encapsulation:Encapsulation is often mean to achieve abstraction  by hiding internal details
and only exposing what is  necessary.

->Wrapping or bundling of data and methods.
->It is a way to achieve  or implement abstraction.
->Why:
    Easy to handle
    Protect integrity.
    control how class data is modified.
->Perfect Encapsulation:If all data members are private.
     Through getter /setter we can access.



3.Inheritance:
->  SuperClass || ParentClass|| BaseClass
       ->>>>>>>
       ->>>>>>>
       subClass || childClass || DerivedClass

->Syntax:
    class Child_Name :Mode_of_Inheritance Parent_Name{....}
    where:Mode_of_Inheritance=public, private, protected.

->Code Reusable, increase code extensibility.
